Thanks for giving the ${pkg.name} a try. ðŸŽ‰

This project includes two config files in ${chalk.yellow('./config')}
  - website.js
  - theme.js
The values you set in ${chalk.yellow('website.js')} will affect components, gatsby-config.js, SEO, and other files.
The values you set in ${chalk.yellow('theme.js')} will only affect the styling of your page (via the ThemeProvider of emotion).

Happy with your setup? Great!
You can start the development server like that:
${chalk.yellow('npm run dev')} to start a development server at ${chalk.green('localhost:8000')} and open the browser
or
${chalk.yellow('npm run build')} to create a production ready static site in ${chalk.green('./public')}.
To test the production build you can run ${chalk.yellow('npm run serve')}.

For further information check the readme of the project
