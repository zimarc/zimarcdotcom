Hi!
I hope you like this theme and enjoy working with it. I've also made other themes! You can check them out here: [Gatsby Starter Portfolio Overview](https://gatsby-starter-portfolio.netlify.com/).


If you want to see more of my work I recommend visiting my [personal portfolio](https://www.lekoarts.de). By pledging to my [patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/lekoarts) you help me making more themes and creating more tutorials. Thanks!
